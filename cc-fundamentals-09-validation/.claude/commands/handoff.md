# Handoff (Module 09: Validation)

Create a handoff document to preserve context for the next session.

## Arguments

- `$1` (optional): Session name/description

## Workflow

### Step 1: Analyze Current State

Gather information about the current session:
1. Check `validation/validation-log.md` for recent validations
2. Check `docs/retrospectives/` for recent retrospectives
3. Look for uncommitted changes with `git status`
4. Identify any failing tests or pending issues

### Step 2: Determine Handoff Filename

Format: `handoff-YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-[session-name].md`

- Date: Current date
- Number: Sequential for the day (001, 002...)
- Session name: From argument or "session"

### Step 3: Create Handoff Document

Write to `specs/handoffs/[filename]`:

```markdown
# Handoff: [Session Name]

**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
**Module**: 09-validation

## Session Summary

## Next Steps

```

### Step 4: Report

```
Handoff Created

File: specs/handoffs/[filename]
Session: [session name]
Date: [date]

Summary:
