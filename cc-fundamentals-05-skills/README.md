## Make It Your Own

After cloning, remove the original remote and create your own GitHub repository:

**Windows (PowerShell)**
```powershell
git remote remove origin
gh repo create cc-fundamentals-05-skills --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

**Mac / Linux**
```bash
git remote remove origin
gh repo create cc-fundamentals-05-skills --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

> **Prerequisite:** Install the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) — `winget install GitHub.cli` (Windows) or `brew install gh` (Mac), then run `gh auth login` once.

## Before We Start

Commands are single-file instructions. Skills are complete capability packages with scripts, references, and workflows. If commands are recipe cards, skills are entire cookbooks.

This module teaches you:
- The difference between skills and commands
- How skills enhance MCPs
- What goes inside a skill
- How to create your own skills

## What's a Skill?

A skill is a folder containing:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md           # Entry point (required)
├── scripts/           # Executable code (optional)
├── references/        # Documentation loaded when needed (optional)
├── assets/            # Templates, images, files for output (optional)
└── cookbook/          # Step-by-step recipes (optional)
```

Skills trigger automatically when Claude recognizes keywords in your request, or you can invoke them directly with `/skill-name`.

## Quick Comparison

| Aspect | Commands | Skills |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Structure | Single `.md` file | Folder with multiple files |
| Location | `.claude/commands/` | `.claude/skills/` |
| Trigger | `/command-name` | Keywords or `/skill-name` |
| Complexity | One workflow | Multiple related workflows |
| Best for | Quick automation | Domain expertise |

## Key Takeaway

Skills are how you teach Claude specialized knowledge that no model can fully possess out of the box. They combine:

- **Workflow guidance** - How to approach problems
- **Scripts** - Reliable code for complex operations
- **References** - Domain knowledge loaded when needed
- **Assets** - Templates and files for output

When you find yourself explaining the same workflow repeatedly, it's time to create a skill.
